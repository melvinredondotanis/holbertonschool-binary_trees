## :file_folder: :mag_right:  About this project...

Tara QUARTERO and Melvin REDONDO--TANIS from Holberton campus in Fréjus are working together on this project.

### :small_orange_diamond: Task 0 - Write a function that creates a binary tree node
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 1 - Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 2 - Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 3 - Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 4 - Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 5 - Write a function that checks if a given node is a root
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 6 - Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 7 - Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 8 - Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 9 - Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 10 - Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 11 - Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 12 - Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 13 - Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 14 - Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 15 - Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 16 - Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 17 - Write a function that finds the sibling of a node
### :small_orange_diamond: Task 18 - Write a function that finds the uncle of a node
